      content: >
        Our aristocratic apartment - Óváros Boutique - is located right in the middle of Veszprém, on Óváros tér, the expression „everything is within arm's reach” is not a marketing ploy: the Veszprém Castle, the Heroes' Gate, the Fire Tower, Dubniczay Palace, St. Michael's Cathedral are a 2-minute walk away available. Óváros tér is the beating heart of Veszprém. Veszprém, which was chosen as Europe's cultural capital, and the nearby Bakony and Balaton offer many opportunities, and the apartment is an ideal starting point for pampering yourself in the many restaurants, design cafes, or fascinating museums of the area. Festival in Veszprém? A hike in Bakony? Skiing in Eplény? Balaton swimming, bobsledding, wine tasting? Or just comfort and relaxation for two on the king-size bed, from which we don't have to miss the latest Netflix series?
        
        
        The choice is yours...
        
        
        We look forward to seeing you!

        • You like to take care of the food (breakfast, lunch, dinner) according to your own taste. Our fully equipped kitchen and dining room will help you with this.


        • You would retreat a little from the hectic everyday life in an intimate way. The check-in and check-out and the operation of the locks are done with the help of a mobile application. The caterers are of course available by phone if necessary, but it is not necessary to meet them in person on-site.


        • Proximity to the city center and attractions is important to you.

      review: Ideális elhelyezkedés, minden fontos szolgáltatás és látnivaló gyalogosan elérhető, de a lakás csendes, mert egy kis utcában található. A lakás stílusosan berendezett, jól felszerelt, ragyogó tisztaság, az ágy nagyon kényelmes. Tetszett a különleges falfestés és az üdvözlőajándék is. Plusz pont jár az intelligens zárnak, remek megoldás, amivel teljesen önállóan érkezhetsz és távozhatsz.
